A partially finished game, designed to get a handle on how to
render at 60fps in canvas. 

The meter at the top changes depending on whether you prefer to 
jump or prefer to hit the bad guys. Jumping makes you better at jumping
but worse at fighting, and vice-versa. Eventually this will make a
difference.

Vaguely inspired by http://games.adultswim.com/robot-unicorn-attack-heavy-metal-twitchy-online-game.html. Should have three different bits of
background music, all with the same underlying beat, so they can be
faded up and down on one another seamlessly; if you're in the middle
of the meter, you get some fairly boring music; if you're on the jumping
side (you jump a lot, and hav therefore got powerful at it) the music
will be airy, floaty, but still metal -- Stratovarius sort of thing. If
you're on the fighty side, the music should be heavy power metal
stuff -- Teutonic knights thundering out of the fog brandishing steel,
Manowar sort of thing.
